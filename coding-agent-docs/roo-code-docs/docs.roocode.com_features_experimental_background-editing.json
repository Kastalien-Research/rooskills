While it can significantly improve workflow, you'll need to manually review changes through source control or file history.\n\n* * *\n\n## Overview [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#overview \"Direct link to Overview\")\n\nThe \"Background Editing\" setting is an experimental feature that disables automatic diff view displays when Roo Code edits files. Instead of switching your editor focus to show diffs, Roo works silently in the background, allowing you to continue coding without interruption. This feature affects all file editing operations including write, apply diff, search/replace, insert content, and multi-file apply diff tools.\n\n### Key Benefits [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#key-benefits \"Direct link to Key Benefits\")\n\n- **Uninterrupted Focus**: Stay in your current file while Roo makes changes\n- **Smoother Workflow**: No context switching between files\n- **Background Processing**: File edits happen silently\n- **Reduced Distractions**: Maintain your coding flow\n- **Performance**: Faster file operations without UI updates\n- **Batch Operations**: Ideal for large refactoring or multiple file updates\n\n### Trade-offs [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#trade-offs \"Direct link to Trade-offs\")\n\n- **No Visual Confirmation**: You won't see diffs as changes are made\n- **Manual Review Required**: Check changes through Git or file history\n- **Less Immediate Feedback**: Changes aren't immediately visible\n- **Silent Changes**: Files change without visual notification - check Git status regularly\n- **Limited Environment Context**: Roo won't see recently edited files as open tabs in its environment details since they're not visually opened\n\n* * *\n\n## Enabling the Feature [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#enabling-the-feature \"Direct link to Enabling the Feature\")\n\nTo enable Background Editing:\n\n1. Open Roo Code settings (gear icon in the top right)\n2. Navigate to the \"Experimental\" tab\n3. Find \"Background editing\" in the list\n4. Toggle the setting to enable it\n\n![Background editing setting in Roo Code experimental features](https://docs.roocode.com/img/background-editing/background-editing.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## How It Works [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#how-it-works \"Direct link to How It Works\")\n\n### Default Behavior (Feature Disabled) [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#default-behavior-feature-disabled \"Direct link to Default Behavior (Feature Disabled)\")\n\nWithout this feature, when Roo edits a file:\n\n1. The file opens in your editor\n2. A diff view appears showing changes\n3. Your focus shifts to the modified file\n4. You review and potentially adjust changes\n\n### With Feature Enabled [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#with-feature-enabled \"Direct link to With Feature Enabled\")\n\nWhen enabled, Roo's file edits:\n\n1. Happen silently in the background\n2. Don't open new editor tabs\n3. Don't show diff views\n4. Don't interrupt your current work\n5. Still open files in memory for diagnostic detection (not visible)\n\n### What Still Happens [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#what-still-happens \"Direct link to What Still Happens\")\n\nEven with the feature enabled:\n\n- Files are still modified on disk\n- Changes appear in source control\n- File watchers and build tools detect changes\n- Roo's chat shows what files were edited\n- Error detection and diagnostics continue to work normally\n- Files are opened in memory for diagnostic purposes (not visible in editor)\n- Write delays for diagnostic detection are still respected\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Use Cases [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#best-use-cases \"Direct link to Best Use Cases\")\n\nThis feature is particularly beneficial for:\n\n- **Large Refactoring Operations**: When Roo needs to update many files\n- **Batch File Updates**: Making similar changes across multiple files\n- **Performance-Sensitive Tasks**: When UI updates would slow down operations\n- **Focused Coding Sessions**: When you want to avoid context switches\n- **Automated Workflows**: Running multiple file operations in sequence\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Practices [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#best-practices \"Direct link to Best Practices\")\n\nWhen using this feature:\n\n1. **Use Version Control**: Regularly check Git status to track changes\n2. **Review Periodically**: Don't let too many changes accumulate without review\n3. **Enable Selectively**: Consider enabling for specific task types\n4. **Monitor Chat**: Pay attention to Roo's messages about file modifications\n5. **Check Diagnostics**: Ensure your editor's problems panel stays visible\n\n* * *\n\n## FAQ [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing\\#faq \"Direct link to FAQ\")\n\n**Q: Can I still see what files Roo edited?**\nA: Yes, Roo's chat messages list all modified files, and changes appear in source control.\n\n**Q: What if I need to see a specific change immediately?**\nA: You can manually open the file and use source control to view the diff.\n\n**Q: Does this affect Roo's ability to edit files?**\nA: No, Roo can still make all the same edits; only the display behavior changes. All file editing tools (write, apply diff, search/replace, insert content, and multi-file apply diff) respect this setting.\n\n**Q: Can I enable this for specific projects only?**\nA: Currently, this is a global setting that affects all projects.\n\n**Q: What happens to approval dialogs?**\nA: File edit approvals still appear if you haven't auto-approved them; only the diff display is suppressed.\n\n**Q: Do diagnostics and error detection still work?**\nA: Yes, files are opened in memory for diagnostic detection, so error checking continues to function normally even though files aren't displayed.\n\n**Q: How does this feature appear in the settings?**\nA: In the Experimental tab, it's labeled as \"Background editing\" with a description about preventing editor focus disruption.\n\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/edit/main/docs/features/experimental/background-editing.md)\n\nLast updated on **Oct 3, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nPower Steering](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/power-steering) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nImage Generation](https://docs.roocode.com/features/image-generation)\n\n- [Overview](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#overview)\n  - [Key Benefits](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#key-benefits)\n  - [Trade-offs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#trade-offs)\n- [Enabling the Feature](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#enabling-the-feature)\n- [How It Works](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#how-it-works)\n  - [Default Behavior (Feature Disabled)](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#default-behavior-feature-disabled)\n  - [With Feature Enabled](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#with-feature-enabled)\n  - [What Still Happens](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#what-still-happens)\n- [Best Use Cases](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#best-use-cases)\n- [Best Practices](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#best-practices)\n- [FAQ](https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/background-editing#faq)\n\n![Roo Code Logo](https://docs.roocode.com/img/roo-code-logo-dark.png)\n\nEmpowering developers to build better software faster with AI-powered tools and insights.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code)[Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RooCode/)[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/roo_code)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roo-code)[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@roo.code)[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/roocode.bsky.social)\n\nGitHub\n\n- [Issues](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues)\n- [Feature Requests](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop)\n\nDownload\n\n- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline)\n- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/RooVeterinaryInc/roo-cline)\n\nCompany\n\n- [Contact](mailto:support@roocode.com)\n- [Careers](https://careers.roocode.com/)\n- [Website Privacy Policy](https://roocode.com/privacy)\n- [Extension Privacy Policy](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)\n\nLike most of the internet, we use cookies.
