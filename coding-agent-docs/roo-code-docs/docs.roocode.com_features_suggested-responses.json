To make responding easier and faster, Roo often provides suggested answers alongside the question.\n\n* * *\n\n## Overview [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses\\#overview \"Direct link to Overview\")\n\nSuggested Responses appear as clickable buttons directly below Roo's question in the chat interface. They offer pre-formulated answers relevant to the question, helping you provide input quickly.\n\n![Example of Roo asking a question with suggested response buttons below it](https://docs.roocode.com/img/suggested-responses/suggested-responses.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## How It Works [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses\\#how-it-works \"Direct link to How It Works\")\n\n1. **Question Appears**: Roo asks a question using the `ask_followup_question` tool.\n2. **Suggestions Displayed**: If suggestions are provided by Roo, they appear as buttons below the question.\n3. **Interaction**: You can interact with these suggestions in two ways.\n\n* * *\n\n## Interacting with Suggestions [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses\\#interacting-with-suggestions \"Direct link to Interacting with Suggestions\")\n\nYou have three options for using suggested responses:\n\n1. **Direct Selection**:\n   - **Action**: Simply click the button containing the answer you want to provide.\n   - **Result**: The selected answer is immediately sent back to Roo as your response. This is the quickest way to reply if one of the suggestions perfectly matches your intent.\n2. **Keyboard Shortcut**:\n   - **Action**: Use the `roo.acceptInput` command with your configured keyboard shortcut.\n   - **Result**: The primary (first) suggestion button is automatically selected.\n   - **Note**: For setup details, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://docs.roocode.com/features/keyboard-shortcuts).\n3. **Edit Before Sending**:\n   - **Action**:\n     - Hold down `Shift` and click the suggestion button.\n     - _Alternatively_, hover over the suggestion button and click the pencil icon () that appears.\n   - **Result**: The text of the suggestion is copied into the chat input box. You can then modify the text as needed before pressing Enter to send your customized response. This is useful when a suggestion is close but needs minor adjustments.\n\n![Chat input box showing text copied from a suggested response, ready for editing](https://docs.roocode.com/img/suggested-responses/suggested-responses-1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Benefits [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses\\#benefits \"Direct link to Benefits\")\n\n- **Speed**: Quickly respond without typing full answers.\n- **Clarity**: Suggestions often clarify the type of information Roo needs.\n- **Flexibility**: Edit suggestions to provide precise, customized answers when needed.\n\nThis feature streamlines the interaction when Roo requires clarification, allowing you to guide the task effectively with minimal effort.\n\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/edit/main/docs/features/suggested-responses.md)\n\nLast updated on **Oct 3, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nSlash Commands](https://docs.roocode.com/features/slash-commands) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nTask Todo List](https://docs.roocode.com/features/task-todo-list)\n\n- [Overview](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses#overview)\n- [How It Works](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses#how-it-works)\n- [Interacting with Suggestions](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses#interacting-with-suggestions)\n- [Benefits](https://docs.roocode.com/features/suggested-responses#benefits)\n\n![Roo Code Logo](https://docs.roocode.com/img/roo-code-logo-dark.png)\n\nEmpowering developers to build better software faster with AI-powered tools and insights.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code)[Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RooCode/)[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/roo_code)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roo-code)[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@roo.code)[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/roocode.bsky.social)\n\nGitHub\n\n- [Issues](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues)\n- [Feature Requests](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop)\n\nDownload\n\n- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline)\n- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/RooVeterinaryInc/roo-cline)\n\nCompany\n\n- [Contact](mailto:support@roocode.com)\n- [Careers](https://careers.roocode.com/)\n- [Website Privacy Policy](https://roocode.com/privacy)\n- [Extension Privacy Policy](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)\n\nLike most of the internet, we use cookies.
