Open Settings by clicking the gear icon  → Checkpoints\n\n2. Check or uncheck the \"Enable automatic checkpoints\" checkbox\n![Checkpoint settings in Roo Code configuration](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## How Checkpoints Work [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#how-checkpoints-work \"Direct link to How Checkpoints Work\")\n\nRoo Code captures snapshots of your project's state using a shadow Git repository, separate from your main version control system. These snapshots, called checkpoints, are automatically created **before** file modifications occur, ensuring you can always undo unwanted changes. Checkpoints are recorded when tasks begin and before file modifications. They are not automatically created before command execution.\n\nCheckpoints are stored as Git commits in the shadow repository, capturing:\n\n- File content changes\n- New files added\n- Deleted files\n- Renamed files\n- Binary file changes\n\n* * *\n\n## Working with Checkpoints [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#working-with-checkpoints \"Direct link to Working with Checkpoints\")\n\nCheckpoints are integrated directly into your workflow through the chat interface.\n\nCheckpoints appear directly in your chat history:\n\n- **Task checkpoint** marks your starting project state\n![Task checkpoint indicator in chat](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-1.png)\n- **Regular checkpoints** are created before file modifications, allowing easy undo of any changes\n![Regular checkpoint indicator in chat](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-2.png)\n\nEach checkpoint provides two primary functions:\n\n### Viewing Differences [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#viewing-differences \"Direct link to Viewing Differences\")\n\nTo compare your current workspace with a previous checkpoint:\n\n1. Locate the checkpoint in your chat history\n\n2. Click the checkpoint's `View Differences` button\n![View Differences button interface](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-6.png)\n3. Review the differences in the comparison view:\n   - Added lines are highlighted in green\n   - Removed lines are highlighted in red\n   - Modified files are listed with detailed changes\n   - Renames may not always be detected; diffs reflect per-file changes between commits\n   - New or deleted files are clearly marked\n\n![View differences option for checkpoints](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-3.png)\n\n### Restoring Checkpoints [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#restoring-checkpoints \"Direct link to Restoring Checkpoints\")\n\nTo restore a project to a previous checkpoint state:\n\n1. Locate the checkpoint in your chat history\n\n2. Click the checkpoint's `Restore Checkpoint` button\n![Restore checkpoint button interface](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-7.png)\n3. Choose one of these restoration options:\n![Restore checkpoint option](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-4.png)   - **Restore Files Only** \\- Reverts only workspace files to checkpoint state without modifying conversation history. Ideal for comparing alternative implementations while maintaining chat context, allowing you to seamlessly switch between different project states. This option does not require confirmation and lets you quickly switch between different implementations.\n\n   - **Restore Files & Task** \\- Reverts both workspace files AND removes all subsequent conversation messages. Use when you want to completely reset both your code and conversation back to the checkpoint's point in time. This option requires confirmation in a dialog as it cannot be undone.\n     ![Confirmation dialog for restoring checkpoint with files & task](https://docs.roocode.com/img/checkpoints/checkpoints-9.png)\n\n### Limitations and Considerations [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#limitations-and-considerations \"Direct link to Limitations and Considerations\")\n\n- **Scope**: Checkpoints only capture changes made during active Roo Code tasks\n- **External changes**: Modifications made outside of tasks (manual edits, other tools) aren't included\n- **Large files**: Very large binary files may impact performance\n- **Unsaved work**: Restoration will overwrite any unsaved changes in your workspace\n- **Timing**: Checkpoints are created before changes are applied, providing a safety net for all modifications\n\n* * *\n\n## Technical Implementation [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#technical-implementation \"Direct link to Technical Implementation\")\n\n### Checkpoint Architecture [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#checkpoint-architecture \"Direct link to Checkpoint Architecture\")\n\nThe checkpoint system consists of:\n\n1. **Shadow Git Repository**: A separate Git repository created specifically for checkpoint tracking that functions as the persistent storage mechanism for checkpoint state.\n\n2. **Checkpoint Service**: Handles Git operations and state management through:\n   - Repository initialization\n   - Checkpoint creation and storage\n   - Diff computation\n   - State restoration\n3. **UI Components**: Interface elements displayed in the chat that enable interaction with checkpoints.\n\n\n### Restoration Process [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#restoration-process \"Direct link to Restoration Process\")\n\nWhen restoration executes, Roo Code:\n\n- Performs a hard reset to the specified checkpoint commit\n- Copies all files from the shadow repository to your workspace\n- Updates internal checkpoint tracking state\n\n### Storage Type [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#storage-type \"Direct link to Storage Type\")\n\nCheckpoints are task-scoped, meaning they are specific to a single task.\n\n### Diff Computation [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#diff-computation \"Direct link to Diff Computation\")\n\nCheckpoint comparison uses Git's underlying diff capabilities to produce structured file differences:\n\n- Modified files show line-by-line changes\n- Binary files are properly detected and handled\n- Rename detection may be limited; diffs focus on file content changes between checkpoints\n- File creation and deletion are clearly identified\n\n### File Exclusion and Ignore Patterns [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#file-exclusion-and-ignore-patterns \"Direct link to File Exclusion and Ignore Patterns\")\n\nThe checkpoint system uses intelligent file exclusion to track only relevant files:\n\n#### Built-in Exclusions [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#built-in-exclusions \"Direct link to Built-in Exclusions\")\n\nThe system has comprehensive built-in exclusion patterns that automatically ignore:\n\n- Build artifacts and dependency directories ( `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`)\n- Media files and binary assets (images, videos, audio)\n- Cache and temporary files ( `.cache/`, `.tmp/`, `.bak`)\n- Configuration files with sensitive information ( `.env`)\n- Large data files (archives, executables, binaries)\n- Database files and logs\n\nThese patterns are written to the shadow repository's `.git/info/exclude` file during initialization.\n\n#### .gitignore Support [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#gitignore-support \"Direct link to .gitignore Support\")\n\nThe checkpoint system respects `.gitignore` patterns in your workspace:\n\n- Files excluded by `.gitignore` won't trigger checkpoint creation\n- Excluded files won't appear in checkpoint diffs\n- Standard Git ignore rules apply when staging file changes\n\n#### Git LFS Patterns [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#git-lfs-patterns \"Direct link to Git LFS Patterns\")\n\nPatterns defined in your workspace's `.gitattributes` for Git LFS are read and added to checkpoint exclusions. This helps avoid tracking large LFS-managed assets in the shadow repository.\n\n#### .rooignore Behavior [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#rooignore-behavior \"Direct link to .rooignore Behavior\")\n\nThe `.rooignore` file (which controls AI access to files) is separate from checkpoint tracking:\n\n- Files excluded by `.rooignore` but not by `.gitignore` will still be checkpointed\n- Changes to AI-inaccessible files can still be restored through checkpoints\n\nThis separation is intentional, as `.rooignore` limits which files the AI can access, not which files should be tracked for version history.\n\n#### Nested Git Repositories [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#nested-git-repositories \"Direct link to Nested Git Repositories\")\n\nIf nested Git repositories are detected in your workspace, checkpoints are disabled. You'll receive a clear notification when checkpoint initialization fails due to nested repositories. Remove or relocate nested repositories to enable checkpoints.\n\n### Concurrency Control [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#concurrency-control \"Direct link to Concurrency Control\")\n\nThe extension prevents duplicate checkpointing within a single streaming operation. There is no dedicated Git operation queue.\n\n* * *\n\n## Git Installation [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#git-installation \"Direct link to Git Installation\")\n\nCheckpoints require Git to be installed on your system. The implementation uses the `simple-git` library, which relies on Git command-line tools to create and manage shadow repositories.\n\n### macOS [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#macos \"Direct link to macOS\")\n\n1. **Install with Homebrew (recommended)**:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nbrew install git\n\n```\n\n2. **Alternative: Install with Xcode Command Line Tools**:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nxcode-select --install\n\n```\n\n3. **Verify installation**:\n   - Open Terminal\n   - Type `git --version`\n   - You should see a version number like `git version 2.40.0`\n\n### Windows [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#windows \"Direct link to Windows\")\n\n1. **Download Git for Windows**:\n   - Visit [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\n   - The download should start automatically\n2. **Run the installer**:\n   - Accept the license agreement\n   - Choose installation location (default is recommended)\n   - Select components (default options are typically sufficient)\n   - Choose the default editor\n   - Choose how to use Git from the command line (recommended: Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software)\n   - Configure line ending conversions (recommended: Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style)\n   - Complete the installation\n3. **Verify installation**:\n   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell\n   - Type `git --version`\n   - You should see a version number like `git version 2.40.0.windows.1`\n\n### Linux [​](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints\\#linux \"Direct link to Linux\")\n\n**Debian/Ubuntu**:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n\n```\n\n**Fedora**:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo dnf install git\n\n```\n\n**Arch Linux**:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo pacman -S git\n\n```\n\n**Verify installation**:\n\n- Open Terminal\n- Type `git --version`\n- You should see a version number\n\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/edit/main/docs/features/checkpoints.mdx)\n\nLast updated on **Oct 3, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nBrowser Use](https://docs.roocode.com/features/browser-use) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nCode Actions](https://docs.roocode.com/features/code-actions)\n\n- [Configuration Options](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints#configuration-options)\n- [How Checkpoints Work](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints#how-checkpoints-work)\n- [Working with Checkpoints](https://docs.roocode.com/features/checkpoints#working-with-checkpoints)\n  -
