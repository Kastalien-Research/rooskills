[​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#what-is-codebase-indexing \"Direct link to What is Codebase Indexing?\")\n\n[Codebase Indexing](https://docs.roocode.com/features/codebase-indexing) creates a semantic search index of your project using AI embeddings. This enables Roo Code to better understand and navigate large codebases by finding relevant code based on meaning rather than just keywords.\n\n### How much does Codebase Indexing cost? [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#how-much-does-codebase-indexing-cost \"Direct link to How much does Codebase Indexing cost?\")\n\nCodebase Indexing requires an OpenAI API key for generating embeddings and a Qdrant vector database for storage. Costs depend on your project size and the embedding model used. Initial indexing is the most expensive part; subsequent updates are incremental and much cheaper.\n\n* * *\n\n## Troubleshooting [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#troubleshooting \"Direct link to Troubleshooting\")\n\n### Roo Code isn't responding. What should I do? [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#roo-code-isnt-responding-what-should-i-do \"Direct link to Roo Code isn't responding. What should I do?\")\n\n- Make sure your API key is correct and hasn't expired.\n- Check your internet connection.\n- Check the status of your chosen API provider.\n- Try restarting VS Code.\n- If the problem persists, report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode).\n\n### I'm seeing an error message. What does it mean? [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#im-seeing-an-error-message-what-does-it-mean \"Direct link to I'm seeing an error message. What does it mean?\")\n\nThe error message should provide some information about the problem. If you're unsure how to resolve it, seek help in [Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode).\n\n### Roo Code made changes I didn't want. How do I undo them? [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#roo-code-made-changes-i-didnt-want-how-do-i-undo-them \"Direct link to Roo Code made changes I didn't want. How do I undo them?\")\n\nRoo Code uses VS Code's built-in file editing capabilities. You can use the standard \"Undo\" command (Ctrl/Cmd + Z) to revert changes. Also, if experimental checkpoints are enabled, Roo can revert changes made to a file.\n\n### Roo Code can't write to markdown files. What's wrong? [​](https://docs.roocode.com/faq\\#roo-code-cant-write-to-markdown-files-whats-wrong \"Direct link to Roo Code can't write to markdown files. What's wrong?\")\n\nIf Roo Code fails to write to `.md` files with errors like \"Failed to open diff editor\" or \"write\\_to\\_file tool failed\", this is typically caused by VS Code extensions or settings that interfere with file editing:\n\n**Common causes:**\n\n- Extensions with \"format on save\" functionality\n- VS Code settings that open markdown files in preview mode by default\n- The Markdown Preview extension or similar markdown processing extensions\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- Disable any extensions that automatically format files on save\n- Remove these settings from your VS Code `settings.json`:\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n\"markdown.preview.openMarkdownLinks\": \"inPreview\",\n\"workbench.editorAssociations\": {\n    \"*.md\": \"vscode.markdown.preview.editor\"\n}\n\n```\n\n- Temporarily disable markdown-related extensions to test if they're causing the issue\n- Restart VS Code after making these changes\n\n### How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?
