You can use mentions to refer to files, folders, problems, and Git commits. Context mentions start with the `@` symbol.\n\n![Context Mentions Overview - showing the @ symbol dropdown menu in the chat interface](https://docs.roocode.com/img/context-mentions/context-mentions.png)\n\n_Context mentions overview showing the @ symbol dropdown menu in the chat interface._\n\n* * *\n\n## Types of Mentions [​](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions\\#types-of-mentions \"Direct link to Types of Mentions\")\n\n![File mention example showing a file being referenced with @ and its contents appearing in the conversation](https://docs.roocode.com/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-1.png)\n\n_File mentions add actual code content into the conversation for direct reference and analysis._\n\n| Mention Type | Format | Description | Example Usage |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **File** | `@/path/to/file.ts` | Includes file contents in request context | \"Explain the function in @/src/utils.ts\" |\n| **Folder** | `@/path/to/folder` | Includes contents of all files directly in the folder (non-recursive) | \"Analyze the code in @/src/components\" |\n| **Problems** | `@problems` | Includes VS Code Problems panel diagnostics | \"@problems Fix all errors in my code\" |\n| **Terminal** | `@terminal` | Includes recent terminal command and output | \"Fix the errors shown in @terminal\" |\n| **Git Commit** | `@a1b2c3d` | References specific commit by hash | \"What changed in commit @a1b2c3d?\" |\n| **Git Changes** | `@git-changes` | Shows uncommitted changes | \"Suggest a message for @git-changes\" |\n| **URL** | `@https://example.com` | Imports website content | \"Summarize @ [https://docusaurus.io/](https://docusaurus.io/)\" |\n\n### File Mentions [​](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions\\#file-mentions \"Direct link to File Mentions\")\n\n![File mention example showing a file being referenced with @ and its contents appearing in the conversation](https://docs.roocode.com/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-1.png)\n\n_File mentions incorporate source code with line numbers for precise references._\n\n| Capability | Details |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Format** | `@/path/to/file.ts` (always start with `/` from workspace root) |\n| **Provides** | Complete file contents with line numbers |\n| **Supports** | Text files, PDFs, and DOCX files (with text extraction) |\n| **Works in** | Initial requests, feedback responses, and follow-up messages |\n| **Limitations** | Very large files may be truncated;

Combine multiple mentions in a request: \"Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts\"\n\nThe dropdown automatically suggests:\n\n- Recently opened files\n- Visible folders\n- Recent git commits\n- Special keywords ( `problems`, `terminal`, `git-changes`)\n- **All currently open files** (regardless of ignore settings or directory filters)\n\nThe dropdown automatically filters out common directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, and `out` to reduce noise, even though their content could be included if manually typed.\n\n* * *\n\n## Important Behaviors [​](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions\\#important-behaviors \"Direct link to Important Behaviors\")\n\n### Ignore File Interactions [​](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions\\#ignore-file-interactions \"Direct link to Ignore File Interactions\")\n\n| Behavior | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **`.rooignore` bypass** | File and folder `@mentions` bypass `.rooignore` checks when fetching content for context. Content from ignored files will be included if directly mentioned. |\n| **`.gitignore` bypass** | Similarly, file and folder `@mentions` do not respect `.gitignore` rules when fetching content. |\n| **Git command respect** | Git-related mentions ( `@git-changes`, `@commit-hash`) do respect `.gitignore` since they rely on Git commands. |\n\n* * *\n\n## Related Features [​](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions\\#related-features \"Direct link to Related Features\")\n\n- [Diagnostics Integration](https://docs.roocode.com/features/diagnostics-integration) \\- Learn about automatic error detection and smart severity filtering\n- [Code Actions](https://docs.roocode.com/features/code-actions) \\- Discover quick fixes and AI assistance directly in your editor\n- [Shell Integration](https://docs.roocode.com/features/shell-integration) \\- Understand how terminal mentions work with shell integration\n\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/edit/main/docs/basic-usage/context-mentions.md)\n\nLast updated on **Oct 3, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nHow Tools Work](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/how-tools-work) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nUsing Modes](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes)\n\n- [Types of Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#types-of-mentions)\n  - [File Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#file-mentions)\n  - [Folder Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#folder-mentions)\n  - [Problems Mention](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#problems-mention)\n  - [Terminal Mention](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#terminal-mention)\n  - [Git Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#git-mentions)\n  - [URL Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#url-mentions)\n- [How to Use Mentions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#how-to-use-mentions)\n- [Important Behaviors](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#important-behaviors)\n  - [Ignore File Interactions](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#ignore-file-interactions)\n- [Related Features](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/context-mentions#related-features)\n\n![Roo Code Logo](https://docs.roocode.com/img/roo-code-logo-dark.png)\n\nEmpowering developers to build better software faster with AI-powered tools and insights.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code)[Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RooCode/)[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/roo_code)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roo-code)[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@roo.code)[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/roocode.bsky.social)\n\nGitHub\n\n- [Issues](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues)\n- [Feature Requests](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop)\n\nDownload\n\n- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline)\n- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/RooVeterinaryInc/roo-cline)\n\nCompany\n\n- [Contact](mailto:support@roocode.com)\n- [Careers](https://careers.roocode.com/)\n- [Website Privacy Policy](https://roocode.com/privacy)\n- [Extension Privacy Policy](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)\n\nLike most of the internet, we use cookies.
