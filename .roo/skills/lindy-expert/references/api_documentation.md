## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#what-is-lindy%3F)  What is Lindy?

Lindy is powerful and easy to use platform for creating, deploying and managing AI agents.**The difference?** Lindy’s AI agents don’t just follow scripts — they think and adapt like human assistants. Whether responding to emails, scheduling meetings, or handling customer support, they work seamlessly across your existing tools.

[![Lindy AI automating business workflows](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/what-is-lindy-banner.jpg)](https://chat.lindy.ai/signup)

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#the-problem-with-repetitive-work)  The problem with repetitive work

Every day, knowledge workers spend 40% of their time on repetitive tasks. Email responses, data entry, meeting notes, customer support tickets - the list goes on. These tasks are necessary but not strategic. They’re perfect for automation.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#enter-lindy%3A-your-ai-workforce)  Enter Lindy: Your AI workforce

Lindy transforms how you handle repetitive work by allowing you to build AI agents that don’t just follow rules — they understand context and make intelligent decisions. With no coding required, you can build a team of specialized AI assistants that work around the clock, freeing you to focus on what truly matters for growing your business.New to Lindy? The [Lindy 101 Introduction](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/introduction) is the perfect place to start — it explains all the core concepts and shows you how everything works together.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#no-code%2C-truly)  No-code, truly

Other automation tools still feel like programming. Lindy uses simple drag-and-drop workflows that anyone can build. No technical knowledge required.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#minutes-to-value)  Minutes to value

Most automation tools take weeks to set up. With Lindy, you can build and deploy your first AI agent in minutes.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#actually-intelligent)  Actually intelligent

Traditional automation breaks when something unexpected happens. Lindy’s AI agents understand context and adapt to new situations, just like a human assistant would.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/\#works-with-everything)  Works with everything

Lindy connects to 3,000+ apps right out of the box. Your agents work across your entire tech stack — from Gmail to HubSpot to your CRM.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#overview)  Overview

Monitor and analyze agent performance with detailed task execution data. There are two key options for full observability into your agents:

- `Agent Task Change` trigger wakes up when another Lindy agent performs specific actions (errors, starts, finishes, etc.)
- `Get Task Details` action reads and analyzes everything an agent did during task execution, showing you block-by-block inputs, outputs, and performance data.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#agent-task-change-trigger)  Agent Task Change Trigger

- **What it does**: Triggers when another Lindy agent performs specific actions — perfect for monitoring agent activity and building reactive workflows.

![Agent Task Change Trigger setup](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/observability-trigger.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#inputs)  Inputs

- **Agent**: Select which agent you want to monitor
- **Events**: Multi-select from task states:

  - Task was created
  - Task succeeded
  - Task is working
  - Task was canceled
  - Task failed
- **Filter by subtask title**: Optional — monitor specific subtasks only

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#common-examples)  Common Examples

- **Error Alerts**: Trigger on “Task failed” → Send email with failure details
- **Performance Tracking**: Trigger on “Task succeeded” → Log completion metrics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Trigger on “Task is working” → Send status updates

* * *

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#get-task-details)  Get Task Details

- **What it does**: Reads and analyzes everything an agent did during task execution. Shows you block-by-block inputs, outputs, and performance data for complete observability.

![Get Task Details action configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/observability-get-task-details.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#inputs-2)  Inputs

- **Agent**: Select the agent to analyze
- **Sub Task** (required): ID of the specific task/subtask to examine
- **Max Number of Blocks**: Recommended to set high — controls how much execution history to retrieve

Usually you want to use this action after an “Agent Task Change” trigger and you can leave the fields on “Auto” to pull in the correct agent & task ID.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#outputs)  Outputs

- **Block-by-block execution**: Every action the agent performed
- **Inputs and outputs**: Exact data flowing through each step
- **Performance metrics**: Timing, success rates, error details
- **Task metadata**: Status, timestamps, execution context

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#common-examples-2)  Common Examples

- **Error Analysis**: Get task details on failure → Analyze what went wrong → Send diagnostic report
- **Quality Evaluation**: Get task details after completion → Score performance → Log to spreadsheet
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze slow tasks → Identify bottlenecks → Optimize workflows

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#use-cases)  Use Cases

- Build evaluation tools for agent quality
- Create automated debugging systems
- Track agent performance over time
- Generate detailed audit logs
- Feed execution data to AI for analysis and insights

* * *

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#working-together)  Working Together

These actions are designed to work together for complete agent observability:

![Observability workflow example](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/observability-together.png)

`Agent Task Change` triggers when something happens → `Get Task Details` analyzes exactly what occurredThis gives you full visibility into your agents — you’ll know when they run, how they perform, and exactly what they do at every step.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#advanced-features)  Advanced Features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-Agent Monitoring | Track multiple agents from one observability workflow |
| Performance Benchmarking | Compare agent execution times and success rates over time |
| Error Pattern Analysis | Identify common failure points across different agents |
| Custom Alert Routing | Send different types of failures to different teams or channels |
| Quality Score Tracking | Build evaluation systems that score agent performance automatically |

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/observability\#best-practices)  Best Practices

Choose the Right Events

Focus on the most actionable events — usually “Task Failed” for debugging and “Task Succeeded” for performance tracking.

Set High Block Limits

For Get Task Details, set max blocks to a high number to capture complete execution history.

Feed Data to AI

Use LLM Call to analyze task details — AI can spot patterns humans miss in execution data.

Build Evaluation Tools

Create systematic quality scoring by analyzing successful vs failed task patterns.

- **Access shared drives** and team folders
- **Manage file permissions** and sharing settings
- **Monitor file changes** and folder modifications

Lindy only uses these permissions to access files and folders you specifically configure in your workflows. This access is required by Google’s API to work properly, but Lindy will only interact with the files you direct it to.

File Organization & Management

Structure your Drive automation effectively:

- Use specific folder paths and file names for reliable automation
- Implement proper error handling for permission-related failures
- Monitor file changes with targeted triggers to avoid overwhelming automation

Intelligent File Discovery

Use Google Drive’s advanced search capabilities:

- File type filtering: `type:pdf`, `type:document`, `type:spreadsheet`
- Date ranges: `created:2024-01-01..2024-12-31`
- Owner filtering: `owner:email@domain.com`
- Sharing status: `is:shared`, `is:private`

Permission Management

Maintain security while automating:

- Google Drive integration respects your organization’s sharing policies and security settings
- All operations maintain existing permission structures unless explicitly modified
- Use granular access control with role-based permissions
- Leverage shared drives for team-based automation workflows

Google Drive’s powerful search capabilities combined with Lindy’s automation create efficient document management workflows that scale with your organization’s needs.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#overview)  Overview

Timer provides precise scheduling and delay capabilities for your agent workflows. Whether you need to run tasks on a recurring schedule, trigger at specific times, or add intelligent delays between actions, Timer gives you complete control over workflow timing.

Timer is essential for creating time-based automations, scheduled reports, follow-up sequences, and any workflow requiring precise timing control.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#timer-as-a-trigger)  Timer as a Trigger

![Add Trigger menu showing Timer in the popular section [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-add-trigger.png)

Timer appears in the “Popular” triggers section, offering two powerful scheduling options:

![Timer trigger options showing On Recurring Schedule and On Specific Time [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-trgger-options.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#on-recurring-schedule)  On Recurring Schedule

![Recurring schedule configuration with preset intervals and next run times [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-recurring-schedule-trigger.png)

Create workflows that run automatically on a repeating schedule. You can define any interval in natural language—just type what you want, like “every Monday to Friday at 8am.”

The interface shows when each schedule will next run, helping you verify your timing is correct before activating.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#on-specific-time)  On Specific Time

![Specific time trigger with calendar date picker and time selector [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-on-specific-time-trigger.png)

Trigger workflows at an exact date and time.**Configuration:**

- Visual calendar picker
- Precise time selection (hour/minute)
- AM/PM format
- Clear date display (mm/dd/yyyy)

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#timer-as-an-action)  Timer as an Action

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#set-timer)  Set Timer

Add intelligent delays to your workflows with flexible timing options.

![Timer actions menu showing Cancel Timers and Set Timer options [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-avaialble-actions.png)

Timer provides two essential actions for controlling workflow timing:

#### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#wait-until-specific-time)  Wait Until Specific Time

![Set Timer action configured to wait until a specific date and time [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-until-actions.png)

Pause your workflow until an exact moment:

- Select specific date with calendar picker
- Choose precise time
- Workflow resumes automatically at the specified time

**Use cases:**

- Wait until business hours to send emails
- Delay actions until after an event
- Coordinate with external schedules

#### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#wait-for-duration)  Wait For Duration

![Set Timer action configured to wait for a specified number of minutes [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-for-actions.png)

Add a relative delay to your workflow:

- Specify duration in minutes
- Simple numeric input
- Workflow continues after the delay

**Common durations:**

- 5 minutes — Brief pause between actions
- 60 minutes — Hourly intervals
- 1440 minutes — Daily delays
- Custom — Any duration you need

#### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#ai-powered-timing)  AI-Powered Timing

![Set Timer with Prompt AI mode for intelligent timing decisions [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-actions-ai-prompt.png)

Let AI determine the optimal wait time:

- Switch to “Prompt AI” mode
- Describe your timing needs in natural language
- AI calculates appropriate delays based on context

**Example prompts:**

- “Wait 2 hours after sending the initial email”
- “Delay until next business day at 9 AM”
- “Pause for the time specified in the response”

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#cancel-timers)  Cancel Timers

![Cancel Timers action to stop all active timers [[memory:2619471]]](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-cancel-timer-action.png)

Stop all active timers in your workflow. This action cancels any pending timer delays and prevents queued actions from executing.

Canceling timers is especially useful for outbound sequences. If a recipient responds before a scheduled follow-up, you can use this action to cancel the timer and stop future messages from being sent.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/timer\#managing-execution-paths)  Managing Execution Paths

Both Timer triggers and actions show clear connection points:

- **After wait begins** — Continue parallel tasks
- **After wait elapsed** — Resume sequential flow

This enables sophisticated patterns like:

- Starting multiple timers simultaneously
- Running actions while waiting
- Coordinating complex timing sequences

This is a common mistake: If your timer isn’t working as expected, make sure your next steps are connected to the `After wait elapsed` path.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#quick-overview)  Quick Overview

This Marketing Focus Group flow lets your agent:

- **Simulate** a focus group discussion with distinct personas
- **Iterate** on marketing copy based on participant feedback
- **Score** each version for excitement and confusion levels
- **Refine** automatically until all participants are satisfied
- **Deliver** the final, polished marketing message

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#setting-up-your-focus-group)  Setting Up Your Focus Group

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-1%3A-configure-the-trigger)  Step 1: Configure the Trigger

![Chat message trigger](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-trigger.png)

The workflow begins with a `Chat Message Received` trigger. This allows you to initiate the focus group by sending your initial marketing copy in the task view.No additional configuration needed—just send your copy to get started.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-2%3A-create-focus-group-participants)  Step 2: Create Focus Group Participants

![Focus group personas setup](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-personas.png)

You’ll see three `Chat Send Message` actions representing your focus group:**1\. Focus Group Manager (Johnny)**

- Role: Iterates on copy based on feedback
- Manages the refinement process
- Synthesizes participant input

**2\. Participant #1 (Tinkerer Tommy)**

- Persona: 30-year-old solopreneur
- Perspective: Technical, detail-oriented
- Values: Clarity and innovation

**3\. Participant #2 (Savvy Sarah)**

- Persona: 45-year-old marketing director
- Perspective: Strategic, brand-focused
- Values: ROI and market positioning

We recommend creating personas that match your ICP!

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-3%3A-set-up-feedback-ratings)  Step 3: Set Up Feedback Ratings

![Scoring system configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-scoring.png)

Each participant provides two scores per iteration:

- **Excitement Score**: How compelling is the copy? (0-10)
- **Confusion Score**: How clear is the message? (0-10)

Target: 10/10 excitement, 2/10 or less confusion from ALL participants.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-4%3A-configure-iteration-logic)  Step 4: Configure Iteration Logic

![Iteration conditions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-iterations.png)

Add a `Condition` step that ensures:

- Minimum 3 rounds of iteration
- Continue if less than 3 rounds completed
- Proceed to quality check after 3+ rounds

This guarantees thorough refinement while preventing endless loops.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-5%3A-quality-check-conditions)  Step 5: Quality Check Conditions

![Success criteria conditions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-alignment.png)

Add another `Condition` to check if:

- ALL participants rate 10/10 excitement
- ALL participants rate 2/10 or less confusion

If criteria not met → continue iterating
If criteria met → proceed to final delivery

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/marketing/focus-group-simulator\#step-6%3A-victory-message-%26-final-copy)  Step 6: Victory Message & Final Copy

![Final output configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-final.png)

1. `Chat Send Message` with victory confirmation:






Copy







Ask AI











```
Victory! Explain the final positioning and summarize the whole conversation — what worked, what didn't. Be concise, no yapping.

```

2. `AI Agent` to deliver final copy:






Copy







Ask AI











```
Send the user the final copy so they can copy and paste it. The user MUST receive the complete, final copy after revisions.

```

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#quick-overview)  Quick Overview

Triggers are events that “wake up” an agent and start a workflow. These can include time-based triggers (e.g., every weekday at 9 am), chat-based triggers (when a user starts a new chat), or event-based triggers (e.g., when you receive an email).A single agent can have multiple triggers, either managing different workflows or acting as entry points into the same workflow.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#types-of-triggers)  Types of triggers

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#time-based-triggers)  Time-based triggers

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_3.png)

Starts the workflow at a set or recurring time. Examples include:

- Every weekday at 9 AM
- Daily at midnight
- Weekly on Monday
- Monthly on the 1st

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#chat-based-triggers)  Chat-based triggers

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_4.png)

Starts the workflow when a user initiates a chat. This allows users to interact directly with your agent through the chat interface.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#event-based-triggers)  Event-based triggers

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_16.png)

Starts the workflow when a specific event occurs. Examples include:

- Slack message received
- Email received
- Calendar event started
- New row added to Google Sheets
- Webhook received

Use triggers together with `conditions` to route workflows intelligently based on context.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#trigger-filters)  Trigger filters

A trigger filter allows you to set conditional logic to filter which events will cause your agent to wake up and execute the workflow.You can enable trigger filters at the bottom of the trigger configuration settings. This means you do not have to add additional steps to filter out triggering events from your workflow.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#example%3A-email-received-trigger-setup)  Example: Email received trigger setup

If you want your agent to process only emails with a specific label, you can configure the Email Received trigger to filter by label. This way, your agent will only wake up and run the workflow when an email with that label arrives.

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_8.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#filter-rules)  Filter rules

- Trigger filters are not case-sensitive
- You can add multiple filter conditions and combine them with AND or OR conditions
- Condition Groups allow you to build more complex, nested filtering logic

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#example-filter)  Example filter

In the example below, your agent will only trigger if:

- The Calendar Event name contains “Interview” AND the location contains “1841 Market Street”
- OR the Calendar Event description contains “In-Person Interview”

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#setting-an-offset)  Setting an Offset

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_10.png)

Some triggers, such as the Calendar Event Started trigger, offer a Minutes Offset, which allows the trigger timing to begin before or after the event start time:

- A negative Minutes Offset (-) sets the trigger before the event start time
- A positive Minutes Offset (+) sets the trigger after the event start time

For example, if you wanted a Meeting Prep Lindy to prep you 30 minutes before a meeting, you would set the Minutes Offset to -30. In this case, the workflow would begin 30 minutes before the Calendar Event Start time.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#multiple-triggers)  Multiple triggers

One Lindy can have multiple triggers, either initiating the same workflow or triggering entirely different ones.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#multiple-triggers-for-the-same-workflow)  Multiple triggers for the same workflow

For example, if you receive lead emails from a [contact@company.com](mailto:contact@company.com) email address and also have a form on your website that sends leads to a Google Sheet, you can configure two triggers to aggregate your leads:

1. One trigger would be on an Email Received
2. The other would be on a New Row Added to a Google Sheet

The workflow would execute exactly the same for both triggers.

#### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#how-to-set-up-multiple-triggers)  How to set up multiple triggers

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_13.png)

1. Create your first trigger and workflow
2. Click “New Trigger” in the top left of the Flow Editor
3. Add your second trigger
4. Drag the grey arrow beneath the second trigger and connect it to the appropriate step in your existing workflow

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers\#a-lindy-with-multiple-workflows)  A Lindy with multiple workflows

Under some circumstances, you may want your Lindy to have two distinct workflows. For example, let’s say you want to build a Meeting Notetaker Lindy that can also answer meeting questions in the Lindy app:

![Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_15.png)

1. **First Workflow:** Meeting recorder that joins your meeting, creates a Google Document with meeting notes and saves them in a Folder (triggered by Calendar Event Start)
2. **Second Workflow:** Answer meeting questions with a Message Received trigger. This workflow begins when a user sends a message to Lindy, searches the knowledge base (which queries all the Documents in the Folder created by the first workflow), and then responds to the user.

This example outlines two workflows with different triggers:

- One workflow joins your meetings and takes notes
- The other allows the user to chat with their meetings and get instant answers to questions about their meetings

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#overview)  Overview

Set Variables lets you store temporary data during task execution. Perfect for:

- **Temporary storage** — hold data that doesn’t need to be in global context
- **Data passing** — share information between different parts of your workflow
- **Variable updates** — overwrite existing variables with new values
- **Clean organization** — keep your workflow organized with named references

Variables are scoped to the current task and automatically cleaned up when the task completes.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#set-variable-action)  Set Variable Action

- **What it does**: Creates or updates a variable that can be referenced throughout your current task execution.

![Setting variables for workflow organization](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/set-variable.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#inputs)  Inputs

- **Name**: The variable name that will be used for referencing (becomes the reference key)
- **Value**: The data to store — can be set manually, using prompts with context, or auto mode

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#outputs)  Outputs

- **Variable Reference**: The stored value can be referenced as an output in other actions
- **Updated Variable**: If using the same name, it overwrites the existing variable

Pro tip: Rename the Set Variable action to the actual variable name (like “Set Customer ID”) for better organization when selecting output references from the menu.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#when-to-use-variables)  When to Use Variables

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#common-use-cases)  Common Use Cases

- Store important data before clearing context
- Pass data between different workflow phases
- Keep track of counters, IDs, or status values
- Hold temporary calculations or processed results

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#variable-updates)  Variable Updates

- Use the same variable name to overwrite existing values
- Update variables as your workflow progresses
- Maintain state across different actions and conditions

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/lindy-utilities/set-variables\#best-practices)  Best Practices

Variable Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification
- Rename the action to match the variable name
- Use consistent naming conventions across your workflow
- Avoid generic names like “temp” or “data”

Variable Management

- Store essential data in variables before clearing context
- Update variables rather than creating duplicates
- Use variables for data that doesn’t need global context access
- Keep variable scope limited to what’s actually needed

Workflow Organization

- Group related variables near each other in the workflow
- Use descriptive action names for better output reference selection
- Document complex variables with clear action names
- Clean up unused variables by not referencing them

Time to complete: `5 minutes`

Difficulty: `Beginner`

What you’ll build: `An AI email assistant that automatically responds to inquiries`

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#building-your-first-agent)  Building Your First Agent

In this guide, you’ll learn how to build your first AI email assistant. This will take less than five minutes, and after you’re done, you’ll have an email responder (because no one loves to answer emails themselves).You’ll create an AI agent that:

1. **Monitors your Gmail** for incoming emails
2. **Filters emails intelligently** using conditions to identify business inquiries
3. **Searches your knowledge base** (your website) for relevant information
4. **Automatically responds** with helpful, accurate information
5. **Keeps you in the loop** by BCC’ing you on all responses

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#overview)  Overview

Here’s exactly what we’ll do:

1

Create agent & add trigger

Create a new Lindy agent and add a Gmail trigger to monitor incoming emails

2

Add condition

Add a condition to filter for business inquiries

3

Add knowledge base & actions

Add your website as a knowledge base and configure Gmail actions for automated replies

4

Test & monitor

Test your agent with a real email and monitor its performance

Let’s get started!

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#step-1%3A-create-a-new-lindy-%26-add-a-trigger)  Step 1: Create a New Lindy & Add a Trigger

Click the “New Lindy” button below Home in the top left of your workspace to begin building your AI agent.

![Create a new Lindy](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/new-lindy-agent.png)

Click “Start from scratch” to create a new AI agent.

![Start from scratch option](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/start-from-scratch.png)

Now let’s add the trigger.
Triggers wake up your AI agent when something happens, like getting a new email. [Learn more about triggers](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers).

Use filters to make your triggers more specific and reduce costs. [Learn about cost optimization](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/account-billing/credit-optimizations).

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#setting-up-the-email-trigger)  Setting up the Email Trigger

**Steps:**

1. Click **“Select Trigger”**
2. Click **Gmail**
3. Add the **Email Received** trigger
4. Connect the Gmail account you want your AI agent to monitor

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#step-2%3A-add-a-condition)  Step 2: Add a Condition

What are conditions?
[Conditions](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/conditions) let you define different paths in your automation based on specific criteria. They help your AI agent make smart decisions about which emails to respond to.

Now that your AI agent wakes up with every email, let’s set a condition to define which emails deserve a response.Click the `Condition` step under `Perform an action` and `Search knowledge base.`

![Add condition step](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/add-condition.png)

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#configure-your-condition)  Configure Your Condition

Lindy will only proceed to the next step if the condition is met. Each condition begins with `Go down this path if...`Set your condition prompt to:

Copy

Ask AI

```
the emailer is asking a question about my service, product, or company

```

With this prompt, your AI agent will only continue if it receives relevant business inquiries.

![Condition prompt configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/configure-condition.png)

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#step-4%3A-add-a-knowledge-base-%26-actions)  Step 4: Add a Knowledge Base & Actions

The [Knowledge Base](https://docs.lindy.ai/fundamentals/lindy-101/knowledge-base) is a repository of data from which your AI agent retrieves information. AI agents search through knowledge bases semantically, finding results whose meaning is similar, even if the exact text doesn’t match.For example, searching for “refunds” will also find entries related to “returns.”

Now we’ll give your AI agent knowledge about your business so it knows how to respond accurately.

1. Click “Add step” and select “Search knowledge base”
2. Click “Website”
3. Enter your company website URL and click “Crawl”

Your agent will now have access to all your website content to answer questions accurately.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#add-an-action)  Add an Action

[Actions](https://docs.lindy.ai/core-concepts/actions) are tasks your AI agent performs, such as replying to emails, updating a HubSpot CRM, or creating a Notion page.

Your AI agent now receives emails and searches your website for relevant information. The final step is configuring how it responds.Click “Add step” (the blue plus sign beneath the Knowledge Base) and select “Perform an action.”

![Add action step](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/perform-action.png)

Click the Gmail action in the ´Linked Actions´ section to ensure your AI agent responds in the same email thread.
Select “Gmail Send Reply” to configure your response action.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#configure-your-response)  Configure Your Response

Now customize how your AI agent crafts responses using your knowledge base.

1. Ensure the **Body** field is set to **“Prompt AI”**
2. Add this prompt to instruct your AI agent:

Copy

Ask AI

```
You are a competent email responder that will use context from a knowledge base

to succinctly respond to emailers' questions about my service, product, or company.

ONLY respond with exact information extracted from the knowledge base and keep

emails friendly and informative. Never more than 3 sentences.

```

The “Reply To” field defaults to “All,” ensuring your AI agent responds to the sender and anyone else included in the email thread.

![Gmail reply configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/email-prompt.png)

Pro tip: BCC yourself on responses to monitor your AI agent’s performance.Set the BCC field to “Set Manually” and enter your email address. This gives you visibility into all responses without cluttering the recipient’s inbox.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#step-6%3A-test-your-agent)  Step 6: Test Your Agent

Time to see your AI agent in action!

1. Click the `Save` button to save your workflow
2. Send yourself a test email from a different address (personal email works great) with a question about your business
3. Click “Test Mode” and select your test email

![Test mode interface](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/test-gmail.png)

4. Watch as your AI agent processes the email and generates a response

![Test results showing condition path](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/test-gmail-result.png)

Remember: Improve your agent over time by reviewing its responses regularly and adjust the prompt to better match your communication style.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/start-here/quickstart\#bonus-step%3A-name-and-monitor-your-agent)  Bonus Step: Name and Monitor Your Agent

Give your AI agent a memorable name that reflects its purpose.Once enabled, click “Tasks” to view your AI agent’s activity history and monitor its performance.

- Enroll Contact Into Workflow action starts onboarding sequences
- Create Communication action logs onboarding activities
- Update Contact action tracks onboarding progress and milestones

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/popular-integrations/hubspot\#best-practices)  Best Practices

Choosing the Right Triggers

Pick the best trigger for your workflow:

- Use “New Form Submission” for immediate lead response (fastest activation)
- Use “New Deal In Stage” when you need stage-specific automation
- Avoid “New Or Updated Contact” for high-volume accounts unless you have a strong filter

Setting Up Reliable Workflows

- Always test with real data before going live
- Start with one trigger and one action, then add complexity
- Use Search Contacts before Create Contact to avoid duplicates
- Set up error notifications so you know when something breaks

Managing Data Quality

Keep your CRM clean and useful:

- Use Update Contact instead of Create Contact when the person might already exist
- Always create associations between contacts, deals, and companies
- Log all important communications with Create Communication
- Use lists to segment contacts before running bulk operations

Avoiding Common Mistakes

Prevent workflow problems before they happen:

- Don’t use multiple triggers that could fire at the same time
- Keep polling at 900 seconds to avoid hitting rate limits
- Test triggers with small data sets first before scaling up

When this action is added, you will automatically get an AI Agent step with a Use Computer skill. You can instruct your agent on what to do with the computer in the AI Agent step’s prompt.

![AI Agent with Use Computer skill](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use2.png)

In the Start Computer action, you are able to pick which computer you want your agent to use. A Computer saves the data (website sessions, cache, files) that was generated during the computer’s session.For example, if you log into a website on a specific computer, the computer will save the website session data and remember your login. This enables your agents to do tasks on a computer without requiring you to take control every time you need to log into a specific website.

The computer is automatically set to \[User\]‘s Computer. This means that computer session data will be saved across all your agents and tasks that use this computer. You can create a new computer for this agent if you wish to do so. Assigning a dedicated computer to each agent limits access to only the credentials and websites required for their task, minimizing security risks.

You can also choose to use an Incognito Computer, which saves no data from the session.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/computer-use\#configuring-a-computer)  Configuring a computer

Configuring your computer allows you to set up your computer with the credentials and data needed for it to run its task. For example, if you want your computer to reach out to users on Linkedin for you, you need to provide the computer with your login.

1

Expand the computer view

You can expand a computer by clicking on the arrows in the right corner of the Use Computer card.

![Expanding computer view](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use4.png)

2

Take control when needed

You can take control of your computer by clicking on the browser screen, or by clicking the ‘Take Control’ button when the agent requires you to take control.

![Taking control of the computer](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use5.png)

Review screenshots

You can see a screenshot of what the computer was doing by clicking any given step:

![Viewing computer screenshots](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use6.png)

Conversely, you can minimize it and go back to your agent’s Tasks by clicking the x in the upper right corner.

Computer sessions persist for 30 days after the last action. So, if you last ran a Computer action as part of a task 30 days ago, you will not be able to connect to that computer session and continue using the computer, but you will still be able to see the screenshots from the task.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/computer-use\#using-the-computer-in-loops)  Using the computer in loops

When you attempt to use a computer inside a loop, we’ll automatically insert a Start Computer step outside the loop. This ensures that each loop iteration doesn’t compete to use the same computer at the same time, and allows multiple computer instances to run in parallel.Another way of preventing the agent from using the same computer for every loop cycle is to set the Max Concurrency of the loop to 1. This guarantees that each cycle completes before the next one starts, but it also means your tasks will run sequentially rather than in parallel.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/computer-use\#automation-detection-by-websites)  Automation detection by websites

When using Computer Use within the looping action, a website may detect and block automated behavior. To enable computer automation in these cases, set the max concurrency to a low value between 1 and 5.

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/computer-use\#computer-settings)  Computer Settings

You can manage and configure your Computers in Settings under the Computers tab. Here you can:

- Create a new computer
- View all your computers
- Configure your computers

## [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/skills/by-lindy/computer-use\#example%3A-linkedin-outreach)  Example: LinkedIn Outreach

This example uses Lindy Computer to connect with and reach out via LinkedIn to leads added to a spreadsheet.

1

Set up the trigger

Start by adding the Google Sheets New Row Added trigger. This is what will trigger your computer agent. Configure your trigger by adding the spreadsheet you want to observe.

![Google Sheets trigger setup](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use8.png)

2

Add the computer action

Provide your agent with a computer by adding the Start Computer Action. The computer will automatically be set to \[User\]‘s Computer.Prompt the AI Agent to navigate to LinkedIn and send a personalized DM to the user that was just added to the spreadsheet.

![AI Agent LinkedIn prompt configuration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use9.png)

3

Configure authentication

Save your agent, and start a task by adding a new lead to your sheet.If you have not logged into LinkedIn on your computer previously, you will be asked to take control and log in. You can also configure your computer in the action configuration by logging into LinkedIn to skip this step.

![LinkedIn authentication setup](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/computer-use10.png)

You will only need to do this once per computer. Your agent will now use the saved session data for future sessions.

And that’s it! Your agent will now automatically use the computer to reach out to leads that were added to your spreadsheet.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/customer%20success/voice-support\#step-2%3A-add-context-for-support-knowledge)  Step 2: Add Context for Support Knowledge

Pre-load your support information to ensure fast response times during calls.

![Add Context action](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lindyai/lindy-brand-assets/voice-support-context.png)

- Action: `Add Context`
- Upload lightweight company context: FAQs, key policies, common troubleshooting steps
- Keep it concise — this context stays in memory during the entire call for optimal latency

We use Add Context instead of Search Knowledge Base because even though you can perform actions during phone calls, pre-loading lightweight context helps maintain fast response times.

### [​](https://docs.lindy.ai/use-cases/customer%20success/voice-support\#step-3%3A-inbound-phone-call-agent)  Step 3: Inbound Phone Call Agent
